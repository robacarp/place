This is a tool to help manage a filesystem workflow for my paperless filing system.

The system is rougly:

- Scan a file, which ends up in an inbox
- Move that file into a folder, say `Files/Finances/2018/Bank/CheckingStatements/`
- Rename that file to, `Finances - 2018 - Bank - CheckingStatements - 2018-01-01.pdf`

The difficult part of the workflow when executed manually is consistency, but speed is also an issue. Without any automation it takes about 2 minutes to move each file after scanning.

This tool provides a workstation for executing that workflow, ensures consistency between filenames and directory names, and automates a lot of the process.
